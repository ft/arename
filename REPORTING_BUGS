How to write useful bug reports for arename?


As with bugreports for other programs, too, you should definately include as
much information the system on which the bug is triggered. That includes the
type of OS, the version of it, the version of Perl5, the version of arename and
the version of the information gathering backend Audio::Scan.

That's the bare minimum. Also include anything else you may find useful or
noteworthy. Such things may include the type of file systems which are
involved, or the character encoding used on the system.

Sometimes, especially when you think that a template is expanded incorrectly
(or not at all because a tag is missing, although you're sure it's not) it's
very important what Audio::Scan returned to arename. To do that, arename ships
a tiny script that dumps Audio::Scan's findings to the terminal. That script is
called `asdump' and should come with your arename installation. It is called
like this:

    % perl /path/to/asdump /path/to/the/audio_file.ogg

Please make sure sure to included that output with your bugreport in case of
such problems.

Most importantly, try to be precise and complete when describing your problem.
The less I have to guess when reading your report, the better - for the both of
us. :-)
