4.0 -> 4.1
    + Implement add-ons, previously listed in `arename.hooks', in sub-modules
      to the ARename::* namespace. The official add-ons are documented, see
      "perldoc ARename::ReplaceSpaces" for example. See "EXTENSIONS" in the
      manual for details.
    + The manual points out how to use the same system for "User-defined
      extensions".
    + Add `expand_template_unknown_tag' hook.
    + KillNonASCII module gains ‘sanitisefat’ option (defaults to "off")

3.0 -> 4.0
    + Changed meta-information gathering to one module, that deals with
      all supported file types: Audio::Scan.
    + Added complex template expressions.
    + Support for new file types:
        a) aac
        b) ape
        c) asf
        d) mp4
        e) mpc
        f) wave
        g) wavpack
    + New options:
        a) ambiguoususefirst
        b) checktemplatesinitially
        c) template_aliases
        d) usetypeasextension
    + New hooks:
        a) ambiguoustag
        b) expand_template_pre_expand_tag
        c) expand_template_post_expand_tag
        d) filetype_known
        e) post_fill
        f) post_scan
        g) pre_scan
        h) pre_rename
    + Removed hooks:
        a) expand_template_next_tag
        b) expand_template_postprocess_tag
        c) post_method
        d) post_rename
        e) pre_method
        f) *ALL* file-type specific hooks, like `post_process_ogg'.
    + Hooks with changed API:
        a) startup
    + User settings (e.g. set varname = value) are supported in
      configuration file sections now.
    + New command line options:
        a) --ambiguous-use-first
        b) --list-file-types
        c) --list-exts-for-type <type>
        d) --verbosity <integer-value>
        e) --suppress-skips
    + Removed command line options:
        a) -D (--debug is still there)
        b) -q (--quiet is still there, but deprecated)
    + Changed command line options:
        a) -v: Used to be `--verbose' but now is `--verbosity'.
           `--verbose' is deprecated (may be removed in later versions)
           and is equal to "--verbosity 20".
        b) -Q is now a short-hand for `--suppress-skips' (the old option
           `--uber-quiet' is still supported, but deprecated).
    + Changed Perl API:
        a) `oprint()' deprecated. Will be removed in a later release!
        b) `owarn()' deprecated. Will be removed in a later release!
    + New configuration file options:
        a) `suppress_skips' enables `--suppress-skips'.
        b) `verbosity' sets verbosity like `--verbosity' does.
    + Deprecated configuration file options:
        The effects of the following options are disabled, deprecation
        messages are printed and warnings are emitted. The options will
        be removed at a later date.
        a) `debug'
        b) `quiet'
        c) `quiet_skip'
        d) `verbose'
    + New environment variables:
        a) `$ARENAME_SUPPRESS_COLOURS': Entirely disable coloured
           output from arename (version 4.0 uses colours by default).
    + Identifier aliases let you say "&ar" instead of "&artist".
    + Templates are checked for sanity after arename is done loading
      configuration files.

2.0 -> 3.0
    + Changed option handling completely. Now every option has a
      --long-option (and not all are available via short options)
      Some short options even changed their meaning. Which is the
      main reason for this to be a major version update.
    + List of changed options:
        -M is gone entirely, the option is now: --compare-versions.
        The old -c option is --rc now.
        -m is gone, it is now --copy.
        -c now is the shorthand for --copy.
        -C is gone entirely, the option is now: --post-rc.
    + New options:
        -c (--copy)
        -u (--userset)
        --enable-hooks
    + XDG_CONFIG_HOME support
      The config is now searched like this:
        a) try $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/arename/
           $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to $HOME/.config/.
        b) $HOME/etc/arename/
        c) $HOME/.arename/
        d) $HOME/.arenamerc, $HOME/.arename.hooks etc.
    + Turn off startup messages if $ARENAME_LOAD_QUIET is set to 1
      in the environment at arename's startup.

1.6 -> 2.0
    = Quite a few changes in this release, these are the important
      ones, that are visible to the user:
    + Dropping the .pl suffix of the scripts.
    + boolean parsing is stricter now.
    + string and interger settings are parsed seperately now,
      which changes value checks and default values, too
    + Improved documentation.
    + 'tnpad 0' now switches off track number padding completely.
    + 'hookerrfatal' works as expected now.
    = ARename.pm was thoroughly refactored.
    + Introducing 'warningsautodryrun' option, see manual for details.
    + Unknown config file lines trigger warnings rather then fatal
      errors.
    + Broken section definition starts are fatal now.
    + Beautified -L output
    + Setup files are looked up in more then one place now:
        i)   ~/etc/arename/{rc,hooks}
        ii)  ~/.arename/{rc,hooks}
        iii) ~/.arename{rc,.hooks}
      The first setup directory, that is found wins.
    + Adding new feature: configuration profiles.
      Additional configuration file sets depending on the current
      working directory (see manual for details).
    + -S prints a list of profiles in the active configuration.
    + Use -P to force one or more profiles.
    + debugging can be switched on at runtime, now (see the -D option
      and the 'debug' setting in the manual).
    + Improved zsh completion for all new command line options.
    + Slightly changed, enhanced and improved test suite; See
      TESTING for details.
    + ataglist, when called without arguments tells exactly from which
      arename version it originated from.
    + Adding -M option to arename, to enable the user to check if the
      version of the script and the ARename.pm module comply.

1.5 -> 1.6
    = No big user-visible changes in this release...
    + Introducing a test suite, that should catch stupid bugs, which
      I overlooked in the past.
    + Cleanups in the Makefile.
    + Greatly improved the infrastructure of the project.

1.4 -> 1.5
    + Adding section support in the configuration file (see manual
      for details).
    + The audio file's name is not handed around in subroutine arguments
      anymore. It's available via get_file() and set_file() now. Thus
      *all* hooks can access it now.
    + Hooks with changed API:
        - pre_apply_defaults, pre_template, post_template, post_ensure_dir,
          post_rename, pre_process_flac, post_process_flac,
          pre_process_mp3, post_process_mp3, pre_process_ogg,
          post_process_ogg, next_file_early, next_file_late,
          filetype_unknown, file_done, pre_method, post_method
        - All of these don't get the file name handed over anymore.
    + Adding -L option, which dumps the current configuration if supplied.
    + Adding -c: read a config file instead of ~/.arenamerc
    + Adding -C: read another config file between ~/.arenamerc and
      ./.arename.local
    + Local config files (.arename.local in the current working directory)
      are *not* read by default any more. If you want to enable that
      behaviour again, set the new 'uselocalrc' setting to 'true'.
    + Adding -l: set 'uselocalrc' to 'true' via the command line.
    + Adding canonicalize setting: Even if a relative path name is given
      on the command line, use its absolute file name for processing.
    + Adding canonicalize hook: Only executed if the setting of the same
      name is set to true (see docs for details).
    + Changed API for apply_defaults hook: the %defaults hash is not handed
      over as a reference anymore; Use get_default_keys(), get_defaults()
      and set_defaults() to access it in hooks now.

1.3 -> 1.4
    + Fix installation procedure

1.2 -> 1.3
    + Fix reaction to broken 'set' calls

1.1 -> 1.2
    + fix_template_albumless() hook supplied by Maximilian Gaß
    + user defined variables via 'set' command

1.0 -> 1.1
    + introduce hooks
    + read filenames from stdin (if requested)
    + quiet_skip does not require quiet to be set anymore
      it'll force quiet on itself
