1.4 -> 1.5
    + Adding section support in the configuration file (see manual
      for details).
    + The audio file's name is not handed around in subroutine arguments
      anymore. It's available via get_file() and set_file() now. Thus
      *all* hooks can access it now.
    + Hooks with changed API:
        - pre_apply_defaults, pre_template, post_template, post_ensure_dir,
          post_rename, pre_process_flac, post_process_flac,
          pre_process_mp3, post_process_mp3, pre_process_ogg,
          post_process_ogg, next_file_early, next_file_late,
          filetype_unknown, file_done, pre_method, post_method
        - All of these don't get the file name handed over anymore.
    + Adding -L option, which dumps the current configuration if supplied.
    + Adding -c: read a config file instead of ~/.arenamerc
    + Adding -C: read another config file between ~/.arenamerc and
      ./.arename.local
    + Local config files (.arename.local in the current working directory)
      are *not* read by default any more. If you want to enable that
      behaviour again, set the new 'uselocalrc' setting to 'true'.
    + Adding -l: set 'uselocalrc' to 'true' via the command line.
    + Adding canonicalize setting: Even if a relative path name is given
      on the command line, use its absolute file name for processing.
    + Adding canonicalize hook: Only executed if the setting of the same
      name is set to true (see docs for details).
    + Changed API for apply_defaults hook: the %defaults hash is not handed
      over as a reference anymore; Use get_default_keys(), get_defaults()
      and set_defaults() to access it in hooks now.
1.3 -> 1.4
    + Fix installation procedure
1.2 -> 1.3
    + Fix reaction to broken 'set' calls
1.1 -> 1.2
    + fix_template_albumless() hook supplied by Maximilian Gaß
    + user defined variables via 'set' command
1.0 -> 1.1
    + introduce hooks
    + read filenames from stdin (if requested)
    = quiet_skip does not require quiet to be set anymore
      it'll force quiet on itself
