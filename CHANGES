1.4 -> 1.5
    + adding section support in the configuration file (see manual
      for details).
    + The audio file's name is not handed around in subroutine arguments
      anymore. It's available via get_file() and set_file() now. Thus
      *all* hooks can access it now.
    + Hooks for hanged arguments:
        - pre_apply_defaults, pre_template, post_template, post_ensure_dir,
          post_rename, pre_process_flac, post_process_flac,
          pre_process_mp3, post_process_mp3, pre_process_ogg,
          post_process_ogg, next_file_early, next_file_late,
          filetype_unknown, file_done, pre_method, post_method
        - All don't get the file name handed over anymore
    + Adding -L option, which dumps the current configuration if supplied.
1.3 -> 1.4
    + Fix installation procedure
1.2 -> 1.3
    + Fix reaction to broken 'set' calls
1.1 -> 1.2
    + fix_template_albumless() hook supplied by Maximilian Gaß
    + user defined variables via 'set' command
1.0 -> 1.1
    + introduce hooks
    + read filenames from stdin (if requested)
    = quiet_skip does not require quiet to be set anymore
      it'll force quiet on itself
