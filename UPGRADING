* Upgrade information for arename

Major version upgrades (e.g. v3 to v4) may break backward compatibility in
one or more aspects of the application. This document outlines which parts
of arename's new version need to be considered and possibly checked before
using it regularly instead of the prior major release.


** Version 4

*** Template format strings

In version 4 of the application, the template format was significantly
enhanced. While it is still pretty backwards compatible, it is possible to
construct format strings from versions 3 and older that will result in
non-compatible results in version 4.

The manual page was updated to reflect the new format in detail.


*** Changed meta-information reading backend

Version 4 of arename uses Audio::Scan to gather meta-information from audio
files instead of the many backend modules in earlier versions. This has
resulted in rather big changes while processing files. Changing the hook
API was inevitable. The `CHANGES' file provides an overview of the API
changes. `arename.hooks' has been updated, too, as has the reference
documentation within the manual page.
