arename.pl's test suite


 PRELIMINARIES

  To use this test suite, you will (in addition to the modules arename.pl
  needs anyway) need the Perl modules Make::More and Make:Exception.

  In addition to that, you will need a few audio related tools (because the
  testsuite generates audio data to do tests with):
      + arecord        - record a wav file
      + oggenc         - encode to ogg vorbis
      + flac           - encode to flac
      + lame           - encode to mp3
      + vorbiscomment  - manipulate tags in ogg vorbis files
      + metaflac       - manipulate tags in flac files
      + id3v2          - manipulate tags in mp3 files
      + fakeroot (opt) - fake root previleges


  This test suite should run without failing tests on all systems. If
  you see any failures, report them. Include arename.pl's version,
  Perl's version, your system's version information (e.g. the output
  of 'uname -a') and anything else you consider important. Plus the
  output of the failing test, of course.


 RUNNING THE SUITE

  To prepare needed data files to play with:
    % make prepare-test-data

  That step needed *once* (or after you cleaned the working directory).

  You can run the complete test suite by simply doing:
    % make test

  If you want to run tests by hand, you can use the 'prove' utility,
  from Test::Harness (if you want to look at a problem in detail, for
  example):
    % prove -I. -v tests/data.t


 TESTING THE INSTALLATION PROCESS

  The installation procedure test case needs the 'fakeroot' utility to
  be installed on the system. By default, the test suite looks for
  '/usr/bin/fakeroot'. If you installed it in another location do:

    % make test fakeroot=/usr/local/bin/fakeroot

  If the test suite cannot find fakeroot at all, the installation test
  will be skipped. Thus, fakeroot is optional for the testsuite.

  To run the installation tests by hand, do (from the source's root):

    % fakeroot /bin/sh ./tests/inst_t.sh
