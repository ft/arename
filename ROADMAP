Roadmap for arename version 4

...a roadmap is the death certificate for every open source project...

Things I'd like arename to do:

+ more powerful templates:
    ...are done.

+ support more tags (and meta information):
    ...done.

+ Support different file extensions:
    ...done.

+ Update hooks API:
    - The switch to Audio::Scan will definately break the hook API
      as it is in arename3.x; it will however become more consistent,
      so that's a good thing[tm]. However breaking user visible API
      will require us to bump the major version number again...

+ Update documentation:
    - This, of course, won't be avoidable and I cannot *wait* to get
      to working on that... ...wait, that's a lie. Oh, well..
