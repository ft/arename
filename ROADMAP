Roadmap for arename version 4

...a roadmap is the death certificate for every open source project...

Things I'd like arename to do:

+ more powerful templates:
    ...are done.

+ support more tags (and meta information):
    ...done.

+ Support different file extensions:
    ...done.

+ Support more file types:
    ...done.

+ Update hooks API:
    ...done.

+ Update documentation:
    - This, of course, won't be avoidable and I cannot *wait* to get
      to working on that... ...wait, that's a lie. Oh, well..
