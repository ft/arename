  arename.pl - audio file renaming using Perl


arename.pl is able to rename audio files (mp3, ogg vorbis and flac) by
looking at the file's tags and filling in that information into a
string where it expands the tag information appropriately - the
generated file name is used as the destination for the renaming.

The latest version of arename can be found here:

SCRIPTS

  arename.pl
    This is the program, you want to use.

  ataglist.pl
    This is a helper script, that is used by a zsh function,
    which manipulates tagging information in audio files.
    This script lists tag names and their values, transparently
    for all supported file types. You will probably not find this
    very useful to call by hand.

    If you wonder what that zsh function is about, see:

INSTALLATION

  If you're just interested in the scripts included in this package,
  do (as root):

    # make install

  If you want both, the scripts and the documentation (as root):

    # make install install-doc


ZSH COMPLETION

  arename.pl comes with a completion function for zsh.
  Just copy _arename to your $fpath (preferably somewhere in your
  home directory) and restart zsh.

  Say, you got ~/.zfunctions in your $fpath, do:
    % cp _arename ~/.zfunctions
    % exec zsh

  Done.


TODO
    + code refactoring; possible split of ARename.pm (v2.0)
    + test suite (v1.6)
