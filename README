  arename - audio file renaming using Perl


arename is able to rename audio files (mp3, ogg vorbis and flac) by
looking at the file's tags and filling in that information into a
string where it expands the tag information appropriately - the
generated file name is used as the destination for the renaming.

The latest version of arename can be found here:

SCRIPTS

  arename
    This is the program, you want to use.

  ataglist
    This is a helper script, that is used by a zsh function,
    which manipulates tagging information in audio files.
    This script lists tag names and their values, transparently
    for all supported file types. You will probably not find this
    very useful to call by hand.

    If you wonder what that zsh function is about, see:

    <http://ft.bewatermyfriend.org/comp/zsh/atag-functions.tar.gz>


INSTALLATION

  To install both the package's scripts and the accompanying
  documentation, do the following as root:

    # make install install-doc


MAJOR VERSION UPGRADES

  When upgrading to a new major release like 4.x from 3.x, consult
  the UPGRADING file for information about breakages with respect to
  backwards compatibility. Checking this file is *NOT* optional.


USING arename FROM ITS GIT REPOSITORY

  If you prefer to use arename from its git repo, you are welcome
  to do so. To clone the repo:

    % git clone git://github.com/ft/arename.git

  Remember, that this is development in progress. Please be more
  careful with these versions.

  To get the actual perl script, do:

    % make genperlscripts

  If your Perl5 binary is in a place different from `/usr/bin/perl',
  you may use the `PERL' variable to adjust the path accordingly:

    % make genperlscripts PERL=/opt/perl5.10/bin/perl

  And to generate the documentation, do:

    % make doc

  After these make calls, the installation works as described above.

ZSH COMPLETION

  arename comes with a completion function for zsh.
  Just copy _arename to your $fpath (preferably somewhere in your
  home directory) and restart zsh.

  Say, you got ~/.zfunctions in your $fpath, do:
    % cp _arename ~/.zfunctions
    % exec zsh

  Done.
