  arename.pl - audio file renaming using Perl


arename.pl is able to rename audio files (mp3, ogg vorbis and flac) by
looking at the file's tags and filling in that information into a
string where it expands the tag information appropriately - the
generated file name is used as the destination for the renaming.



SCRIPTS

  arename.pl
    This is the program, you want to use.

  ataglist.pl
    This is a helper script, that is used by a zsh function,
    which manipulates tagging information in audio files.
    This script lists tag names and their values, transparently
    for all supported file types. You will probably not find this
    very useful to call by hand.

    If you wonder what that zsh function is about, see:
